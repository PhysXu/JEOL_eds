Hi everyone, sorry to bother you.
I am a PhD student working on SEM and TEM data. Thanks to hyperspy, I am able to process my SEM data obtained with a Bruker detector (.bcf file). Unfortunatelly for TEM data we have a JEOL detector which provides format that hyperspy can't read. Do you think it will be usefull to add this ability ?
We started to look on Jeol data with some collegues and we succeded to extract the eds hypermap from the .pts file and the haadf image from the .img file. We also managed to decode a bunch of metadata from the .pts file.
I wanted to send you some python plots of the extracted data but I am new on gitter/github and I didn't find out how to do that. If anyone would like to work on this project I would be happy to give a hand.

@sempicor I would suggest making a little github repository with your findings! That is, upload the code you are currently using to extract the eds hypermap, as well as the file you are extracting from.

Hi @thomasaarholt. Thanks for your answer. I created a repository where I put the python script and the jeol data files. I will add other informations we understood on metadata generated by Analysis Station but you can already have a look on the few lines we use to manually extract the data.

I used the repository mentioned in the conversation above as starting point (https://github.com/sempicor/jeol_eds_reader).

jeol_metadata.ods provides some info about the file format(s).

Test data:
512.pts:   jeol_eds_reader-master/Sample/00_View000/View000_0000017.pts (512x512)
256.pts:   #49_20 5D8_EDS/region3/Sample/00_View000/View000_0000010.pts (256x256)
128.pts:   #49_20 5D8_EDS/region2/Sample/00_View000/View000_0000010.pts (128x128)
